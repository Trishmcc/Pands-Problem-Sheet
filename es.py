# sys imports the internal Python module 

import sys

 # First I will open a file using the open function I'm using rt mode to read a text file




with open("moby-dict.txt", "rt") as f:

# I'm using a while loop to perform a Boolean. I'm choosing 1 so every element will be examined


    while x == f.read(1):
        if x == "e" or x == "E":
            return??????

# y is everything that isn't an e and the +1 will add every e found in the text
        
        else:
            y = (0 + 1)?????

            # argv.py


print(f"Name of the script      : {sys.argv[0]=}")
print(f"Arguments of the script : {sys.argv[+1]=}")

#print (x)
