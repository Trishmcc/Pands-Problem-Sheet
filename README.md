## TASK 2

*A program for calculating a persons BMI. The file name is called bmi.py*

### Explanation of code

* These first two lines of code request a user to input their height and weight in kg. I'm using float in my code as the BMI result is in decimal places.

* The next two lines of code convert the height from cm into metres squared using the BMI calculator [1]

* The fifth line of code rounds the BMI to the nearest two decimal places.[2]

* The last line of code prints the result of the calculation.

## TASK 3

*This program will input a string and output every second letter in reverse order. The file name is called secondString.py*

### Explanation of code

* The first line of code requests the user to input a string.

* The second line of code outputs a result. For my output I am reversing the string using splicing. 
  I used two semi colons in square brackets to omit one or more characters. 
  I used -2 as it allows every second letter to be chosen in reverse order.[1]

Week 4: collatz.py completed. This program will input any positive integer and output the successive values of the following calculation: Take the current value and if it is even divide by 2. If the number is odd the multiply by 3 and 1. The program will end if the current value is 1

Week 5: weekday.py completed. A program that outputs whether or not today is a weekday.
