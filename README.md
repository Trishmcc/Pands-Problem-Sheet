## TASK 2

*A program for calculating a persons BMI. The file name is called bmi.py*

### Explanation of code

* These first two lines of code request a user to input their height and weight in kg. I'm using float in my code as the BMI result is in decimal places.

* The next two lines of code convert the height from cm into metres squared using the BMI calculator [1]

* The fifth line of code rounds the BMI to the nearest two decimal places.[2]

* The last line of code prints the result of the calculation.

## TASK 3

*This program will input a string and output every second letter in reverse order. The file name is called secondString.py*

### Explanation of code

* The first line of code requests the user to input a string.

* The second line of code outputs a result. For my output I am reversing the string using splicing. 
  I used two semi colons in square brackets to omit one or more characters. 
  I used -2 as it allows every second letter to be chosen in reverse order.[1]

## TASK 4

*This program will input any positive integer and output the successive values of the following calculation:
Take the current value and if it is even divide by 2 
If the number is odd the multiply by 3 and 1
The program will end if the current value is 1. The file name is called collatz.py*

### Explanation of code

* The first two lines of code request the user to input a number.

* The third line of code is a while loop. I used a Boolean operator. This condition is saying that if x is greater than 1 then its True.[1]

* The next two lines of code implement an if statement. This applies the function so if any number divided by 2 is 0 hence even then divide the number x itself by 2[2]

* The next two lines of code have an else statement applied.  If the number is uneven then multiple by 3 and add 1. I'm using append - Whats before the dot - is added to the array. (x) is what is added to the numbers.
