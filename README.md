## TASK 2

*A program for calculating a persons BMI. The file name is called bmi.py*

### Explanation of code

* These first two lines of code request a user to input their height and weight in kg. I'm using float in my code as the BMI result is in decimal places.

* The next two lines of code convert the height from cm into metres squared using the BMI calculator [1]

* The fifth line of code rounds the BMI to the nearest two decimal places.[2]

* The last line of code prints the result of the calculation.
