#This program will input a string and output every second letter in reverse order.
#Author:Trish OGrady


#I used input to input a string.


inputString = input ('Enter a string:')

#For my output I am reversing the string using splicing. 
#I used two semi colons in square brackets to omit one or more characters. 
#I used -2 as it allows every second letter to be chosen in reverse order.


print (inputString[::-2])
